 # Lab 26 ~ Frontend Tooling and React

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This application is an exploration into using React and Webpack to render HTML from a JS file. It incorporate both Faker and Cowsay to generate new text on a click event, from a listener created using React.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. `npm run watch` will start a server listening on `localhost:8080`. Entering the address into the browser will allow you to see live updates of the rendered application.
